# Problem description 

A machine learning model cannot be built without sufficient data. Quality data is fundamental to any data science engagement. To gain actionable insights, the appropriate data must be sourced and cleansed. There are two key stages of Data Understanding: a Data Assessment and Data Exploration. Our team provides Data Understanding insights within week 9 assignment.<br>

The Pharmaceutical company provided dataset called “Healthcare_dataset” in xlsx format consisting of:
- Missing data in total: .......
- Outliers in total: .......<br>


# Data cleansing and transformation - techniques description


## Missing values (NaN or Unknown in our case)

# Dataset for EDA and modelling

As part of week 9 team worked out the data set for EDA and further modelling.<br>
