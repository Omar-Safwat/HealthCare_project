# Repo Master Branch Structure

* Notebook for each Week.
* General Notebook just for **python code.** 
	* Contains final code from all weeks, and we will update it weekly. Refer to its section for proposed structure.
* Notebook for each team member called "<YourName>-Findings", which should be updated on a **weekly** basis.
  * It will hold work and research you did by yourself.
  * It'll be mainly used for future reference by other team mates. (For example I would like to take another look at the analysis team mate 1 did last week, for my work.)
  * Don't delete your old work, append new cells to your notebook (Markdown, or Python) as you see fit, add headings (# Week 7...# Week 8..etc).
* Presentation slides.

```

Markdown Heading: Week N+2

```{python}
# Python Code
# Machine Learning Model

```

Markdown Heading: Week N+3

```
# Project Outline (Will be updated Weekly)

# Week 7:

## Problem Description: 

* What is the problem. 
* What are the challenges. 
* The disease in question. 
* Mention the variations in 
	* Demographics
	* Provider Attributes
	* Clinical Factors <More detail about the measurements, what is the T-score metioned.>


## Project Lifecycle

 Gant Chart by Roger.


## Data Intake report:

* How data was ingested into our notebook.
* Summary of Data size and features...etc.


## Github Repo Link




# Week 8:

## Problem Description

Repeat from Week 7.


## Data understanding & Preprocessing:

	* What can of Dataset do we have? (Tabular!!)
	* How data are represented? (Categorical data represented Numerically through 0s and 1s)
	* Mention NA values count. (Count of NA values)
	* Mention Outliers. 
	* Exploratory Analysis (Variation in data through box plots and histograms..SweetViz is awesome!)

**NOTE:** Week 9 Deliverables state that we should attempt to deal with NAs through Imputing. So we shouldn't discrad them completely now. 
We could just keep week 8 deliverables as Descriptive as possible (What we've seen in the data, and the insights we have.)
